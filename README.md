# Heart Disease Detection System

This project implements a machine learning-based system for detecting heart disease using Python. The system includes functionalities for data preprocessing, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), and model building. Three classification algorithms—K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machine (SVM)—are employed to predict heart disease based on patient data. The project also provides an interactive interface for users to input their information and receive predictions.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handle missing values and perform one-hot encoding.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualize data distributions and patterns.
- **Classification Algorithms**:
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  - Random Forest (RF)
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- **Interactive Interface**: Users can input their data and receive predictions for heart disease.
